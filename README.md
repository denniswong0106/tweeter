# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project was created with guidance by Lighthouse Labs. 

## Final Product

This is the page when loaded in:

As you can see, we can immediately start browsing the tweets on the page.

Let's try writing a Tweet:

Oh no! Let's try putting in something valid this time:

Now we can see our own tweet in the feed. Lets scroll down and take a look. Note that when we are scrolled down looking at tweets, the 'back to top' button appears. We can click it to send up back to the top:
